ðŸ”” **tl;dr:** Add the `workflow` scope to your Personal Access Token.

Hi @{{TEAM}},

I'm @upptime-bot, the robot who helps you track your websites' status.

GitHub recently updated the scope requirements for the Personal Access Token (PAT) that you set up when you created this Upptime repository. Previously, you only needed the `repo` scope, but you need to **add the `workflow` scope** as well.

[Head to your Personal Access Tokens settings page â†’](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

<small>_Psst,_ this is an automated issue because of a breaking change you need to be aware of. Issues like this will be opened very infrequently (I promise no spam!). However, if you want to disable these completely, you can set `disableAutomatedIssues: true` in your `.upptimerc.yml` configuration file, but note that you'll have to fix your breaking changes manually by reviewing the [upptime/upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime) repository. Thanks for using Upptime! â€” @AnandChowdhary</small>
